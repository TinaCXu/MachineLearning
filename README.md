## Udemy - Machine Learning, Data Science and Deep Learning with Python
 The final project:mammographic masses of Udemy courses

### *1.Evaluated the correlation of missing values & data cleanning & normalization*

### *2.Accuracy of different model*
| **Model**                  | **Accuracy**|
| :--------------------------| ----------: |
| Decision tree              | 0.7373 |
| Random forest              | 0.7528 |
| KNN                        | 0.7941 |
| Naive Bayes                | 0.7844 |
| SVM                        | 0.8012 |
| Logistic Regression        | 0.8074 |
| Neural Network using Keras | 0.8024 |

## Standard & Poor's rating
 Analyzed and predicted the importance of different factors to the Standard & Poor's rating of companies through machine learning

### *1.Feature Engineering*
 * Normalization
 * Remove useless parameters
 * Covert string type parameters into integers

### *2.Balance the data*

### *3.Accuracy of different model*
| **Model**                  | **Accuracy**|
| :--------------------------| ----------: |
| BaggingClassifier          | 0.23 |
| Random forest              | 0.30 |
| SVM                        | 0.22 |

### *4.Analysis*
 * Influnced by unbalanced data: major level BBB, especially level BBB-. The confusion matrix of the SVM models is almost concentrated in the fifth column, the precision is 0.16, and the recall is 1.0
 * Sample data is not enough, limit the performance of machine learning
